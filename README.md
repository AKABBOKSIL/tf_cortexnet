# tf_cortexnet
This repository will be useful for classification of jpg,png images
- function: making directory image lists for training, test
- nnlib: libraries for frequently used neural function e.g. convolutional, pooling
- main: whole steps for classification
- model: network architectures e.g. ResNet, SENet
